# Dotfiles

## Overview
This repository is to keep a central location for all of my dotfiles. I use
these mainly for personal projects as work is kept separate. 
Feel free to install this as a starting point. It is by new means fantastic but
it is always a work in progress.

> **NOTE:** The repository is only editable by me. It can only be cloned but not
> pushed to.

3. Run the setup script to install the files
